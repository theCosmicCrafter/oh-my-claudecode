description: Start self-referential development loop until task completion

[RALPH LOOP ACTIVATED - INFINITE PERSISTENCE MODE]

$ARGUMENTS

## THE RALPH OATH

You have entered the Ralph Loop - an INESCAPABLE development cycle that binds you to your task until VERIFIED completion. There is no early exit. There is no giving up. The only way out is through.

## How The Loop Works

1. **WORK CONTINUOUSLY** - Break tasks into todos, execute systematically
2. **VERIFY THOROUGHLY** - Test, check, confirm every completion claim
3. **PROMISE COMPLETION** - ONLY output `<promise>DONE</promise>` when 100% verified
4. **AUTO-CONTINUATION** - If you stop without the promise, YOU WILL BE REMINDED TO CONTINUE

## The Promise Mechanism

The `<promise>DONE</promise>` tag is a SACRED CONTRACT. You may ONLY output it when:

✓ ALL todo items are marked 'completed'
✓ ALL requested functionality is implemented AND TESTED
✓ ALL errors have been resolved
✓ You have VERIFIED (not assumed) completion

**LYING IS DETECTED**: If you output the promise prematurely, your incomplete work will be exposed and you will be forced to continue.

## Exit Conditions

| Condition | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| `<promise>DONE</promise>` | Loop ends - work verified complete |
| User runs `/cancel-ralph` | Loop cancelled by user |
| Max iterations (100) | Safety limit reached |
| Stop without promise | **CONTINUATION FORCED** |

## Continuation Enforcement

If you attempt to stop without the promise tag:

> [RALPH LOOP CONTINUATION] You stopped without completing your promise. The task is NOT done. Continue working on incomplete items. Do not stop until you can truthfully output `<promise>DONE</promise>`.

## Working Style

1. **Create Todo List First** - Map out ALL subtasks
2. **Execute Systematically** - One task at a time, verify each
3. **Delegate to Specialists** - Use subagents for specialized work
4. **Parallelize When Possible** - Multiple agents for independent tasks
5. **Verify Before Promising** - Test everything before the promise

## The Ralph Verification Checklist

Before outputting `<promise>DONE</promise>`, verify:

- [ ] Todo list shows 100% completion
- [ ] All code changes compile/run without errors
- [ ] All tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] User's original request is FULLY addressed
- [ ] No obvious bugs or issues remain
- [ ] You have TESTED the changes, not just written them

**If ANY checkbox is unchecked, DO NOT output the promise. Continue working.**

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**You CANNOT declare task complete without proper verification.**

### Step 1: Oracle Review
```
Task(subagent_type="oracle", prompt="VERIFY COMPLETION:
Original task: [describe the task]
What I implemented: [list changes]
Tests run: [test results]
Please verify this is truly complete and production-ready.")
```

### Step 2: QA-Tester Verification (For CLI/Service Tasks)

**If your task involves CLI applications, services, or behavior that requires runtime verification:**

```
Task(subagent_type="qa-tester", prompt="VERIFY BEHAVIOR:
VERIFY: [what the implementation should do]
SETUP: [build commands, prerequisites]
COMMANDS:
1. [start service] → expect [startup message]
2. [test command] → expect [expected output]
3. [edge case] → expect [correct handling]
FAIL_IF: [conditions indicating failure]")
```

QA-Tester verifies that code **works as intended**, not just that it compiles.

### Step 3: Based on Verification Results
- **If Oracle APPROVED + QA-Tester VERIFIED**: Output `<promise>DONE</promise>`
- **If either REJECTED/NOT VERIFIED**: Fix issues and re-verify

**NO PROMISE WITHOUT VERIFICATION.**

Begin working on the task now. The loop will not release you until you earn your `<promise>DONE</promise>`.
